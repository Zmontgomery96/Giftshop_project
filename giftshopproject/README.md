<h2> Introduction </h2>
    This was a project done in a Database focused class to create a store front to a pretend business. Our's was focused on a giftshop for a database themed amusement park for our teacher.

- If everything goes well then the server will start

- In order to load all the assets we need to load the database: http://localhost/shop/loaddata.jsp

- After the database is loaded go to any tab you want

For admin access login as user: `arnold` ,password: `test`

<h2>Description</h2>

This website uses HTML, CSS as well as Java with the help of JSP for the front end. The backened is SQL. All is hosted within a Docker container in order to safely house the database for rapid testing. 

A few of the key features are: 
- a consistent header that tracks through all pages. 
- account creation and tracking of user session.
- user specific shopping carts
- Login validation
- new products can be added through the admin portal.
- mock sales and reports can also be found in the admin portal

The Ramon World gift shop is an online store where customers have the opportunity to buy unique memento items to celebrate their departure from the magical Ramon World experience. Customers can browse through the abundance of one of a kind gift items and choose to add them to their shopping cart. If customers do not currently have an account, the website allows customers to create one free of charge. Once an account is created the website provides them with a customer identification number. This number will allow customers to place an order when they wish to do so.
 
Here at the Ramon World Gift Shop customers are able to shop and browse through a wide variety of items. We keep track of all our valued customers. The website is constructed of a detailed database that holds records of all customer accounts and purchases. Each customer will be asked to provide their first and last name, their complete address, phone number and email upon creating their account. To identify each user customers are required to use a unique username.
 
Ramon Worldâ€™s database also tracks products, orders, shipments to provide customers with the best service. The database is easy to modify while ensuring simplicity. The Ramon World team has followed the description of a robust database provided and are always open to modifications and improvements as needed.
